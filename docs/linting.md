# HISTORICAL: Lint Mode Design Document

> **Note:** This is a historical design document from the development of the lint feature. The lint mode has been fully implemented and is documented in the user-facing documentation. See `cli.rst` for current usage.

> **Implementation Status:** âœ… Complete
> - The `lint` command is available: `peter-hook lint <hook-name>`
> - The `per-directory` execution type was renamed to `in-place` in the final implementation

## Original Design Proposal

I want to add a run mode for `peter-hook` that allows us to run the defined hooks against the current directory; in this mode, per-directory hooks run *as if the current directory is the git root*; the file filtering for per-file hooks should return *every matching file* that is not .gitignore'd; and *no git operations should happen*. 

Let's say we have a hook, called `ruff-check`; this hook is defined as so:

```toml
[hooks.ruff-check]
command = ["uvx", "ruff", "check", "--fix"]
description = "Run ruff linter with auto-fix for Python files"
modifies_repository = true
depends_on = ["ruff-format"]
files = ["**/*.py"]
```

When I run `peter-hook lint ruff-check`, I want this to run on *all* python files in the current directory _and subdirectories_. 

Let's also say we have a per-directroy hook, called `unvenv`, defined as such:

```toml
[hooks.unvenv]
command = ["unvenv"]
description = "Prevent pushing Python virtual environments to Git"
modifies_repository = false
execution_type = "per-directory"
files = ["**/*"]
```

If I run `peter-hook lint unvenv`, the unvenv command runs *in the current directory*.

Does this make sense?
